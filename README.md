During our lab time we designed our simulink diagram based on the reference file s_aero_2dof_lqr_control. We were slowed down by issues surrounding the installed Quarc files. The Quarc modules we needed to complete the s_aero_2dof_lqr_control model were not found in the current version of simulink we were working with, which was 2018.
