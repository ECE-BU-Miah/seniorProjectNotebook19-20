Notebook for senior project (2019-2020)



Kickoff meeting (Date: 9/13/2019)
---

Meeting minutes
Set up Github site and notebook
9:00-11:00 1:30-2:30 Tuesdays and Thurdsays lab time each week
Lab time is used for coding and hardware work.
We will share work equally.
Dr Miah will help us install Latex and IPE extensible drawing editor outside of formal meeting.
5 members in research group we can collaborate to learn latex.
research meeting every other friday from 12 to 1
Bibtech need to download for bibliography
For report template it will all be in latex
Dr Miah created a google drive folder for us with referenceable material.
Google drive is where bibliography, referenceable documents, and project documents
Our goal for this semester is to code the previous years projects, then next semester add our own elements

Action: Read Previous years final report from page 1 to pg 37 then prepare a presention based on that and appendix e pg 71 to 74 present on those pages as well. The presentation will be a 30 minute presentation.

Tyler and Chris read the user manual for the helecopters to perpare for working on lab 4 tommmrow.
We plan on working on the project proposal after we implement lab 4.

(Date: 9/24/19)
---
Christopher and tyler both worked to get the simulink models needed for lab 4 done. We got the models 80% done the last thing we need to add is the Helecopter module's. We were unable to find out where they are located during the lab time. We left the lab around 10:50 am.

(Date: 9/25/19)

Tyler and Christopher have agreed to finish the project proposal today so that Dr. Miah has time to give us feedback. We finished at 6:31pm and are going to send it to Dr.Miah

During our lab time we designed our simulink diagram based on the reference file s_aero_2dof_lqr_control. We were slowed down by issues surrounding the installed Quarc files. The Quarc modules we needed to complete the s_aero_2dof_lqr_control model were not found in the current version of simulink we were working with, which was 2018.

During this lab time we edited and fixed our previously mentioned simulink diagram and we solved this issue by making all necessary edits in Matlab 2017a which has the Quarc software we needed to finish our drawings.

After we finished the first simulink model and got it fully functional we began the secound simulink model based on the file q_areo_2dof_lqr_control. We got this similink model around 85% complete the last part we need to add is the Quarc mdoelules which we have not been able to find yet.
